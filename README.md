# A simple ticket bot written in rust

Designed to work in 1 guild at a time 


Default prefix is `.`

```
.panel [channel_id] []

```
# Building

Requirments:
 - cargo/rust (tested on 1.54 and 1.56-nightly)

# Running

```

```

# Plans
 - Split `database.rs` into `database/panel.rs` and `database/ticket.rs`
    - Maybe add wrapper around both as the struct Database
 - Add unit testing wherever possible because trying to debug live is never fun, and is more likely to produce production bugs

# Donations

I don't expect any money out of this and I legit have no clue why im putting this here but: 

Crypto would be best, you can email me at `henry0w@henry0w.com` for paypal or other fiat donations, being a minor is tricky.
